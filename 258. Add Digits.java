/**
 * Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.
 * For example:Given num = 38, the process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. 
 * Since 2 has only one digit, return it.
 * 
 * Follow up:Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?
